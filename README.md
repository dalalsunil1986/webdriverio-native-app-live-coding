# Example project for a live coding session

## Use
Let's suppose you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) already installed. If you don't have Node installed, I recommend installing [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to assist managing multiple active Node.js versions.

Installing of NodeJS is not part of this project

Clone the project to your machine with

    git clone https://github.com/wswebcreation/webdriverio-native-app-live-coding.git
    
Install all dependencies

    npm install
    
Make sure you have iOS simulators / Android emulators on your machine (Check Google on how to install emulators / simulators on your machine, that's not part of this project)

Check the branches and helpers to see if the code it helpfull for you. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/webdriverio/appium-boilerplate)

## Apps
Apps can be found [here](https://github.com/saucelabs/sample-app-mobile/releases), pick the version that's in the config 


Good luck

Grtz,
